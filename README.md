Worffler Benchmark
==================

A wordlist shuffler experiment in several programming languages.  
Just a benchmark test for an upcoming syllable based wordlist generator.

 
### Supported Languages

 - Lua
 - Python
 - C
 - ...

 
### Usage

 Enter the "c" directory and type make to compile the C-shuffler.
 
 A complete benchmark can be performed by executing the bash script "benchmark"
 in the root directory.

 By default, a list of numbers (0..7999) is concatenated to each other.
 
 This number file, as well as a tiny Lua script to generate a new one,
 can be found in the "zdata" directory.
